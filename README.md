**Fraudulent Claim Detection**
Developing a predictive model for insurance fraud detection offers significant business value. Fraud investigations currently rely on manual processes such as reviewing claims, calling claimants and conducting background checks, which are time-consuming and inefficient. These delays allow fraud to go undetected whereas legitimate claims face unnecessary scrutiny. Predictive modelling enables early identification of high-risk claims, streamlining fraud investigations, reducing financial losses and improving operational efficiency. It also enhances customer experience by expediting legitimate claims. Ultimately, an effective fraud detection model leads to better decision-making, optimised resource allocation and increased profitability.

 

**The objective** is to build a model to classify insurance claims as either fraudulent or legitimate based on historical claim details and customer profiles. By using features such as claim amounts, customer profiles, claim types and approval times, the company aims to predict the claims that are likely to be fraudulent before they are approved.

 

**Goal**

Global Insure aims to enhance its ability to detect fraudulent insurance claims by leveraging historical claim data. 

The company seeks to identify patterns and key indicators that differentiate fraudulent claims from genuine ones. 

By developing a predictive model, it intends to assess the likelihood of fraud in incoming claims, enabling proactive fraud detection and reducing financial losses. 

**Overall**, the objective is to build a model to classify insurance claims as either fraudulent or legitimate based on historical claim details and customer profiles. By using features such as claim amounts, customer profiles, claim types and approval times, the company aims to predict the claims that are likely to be fraudulent before they are approved.
